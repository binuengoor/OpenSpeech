#### Syntax Fixes
- ✅ Fixed duplicate catch blocks in `services/ttsService.js`:
  - Line 78: Removed duplicate catch block in `getAllVoices()`
  - Line 115: Removed duplicate catch block in `getVoices()`
- ✅ Fixed broken error handler in `routes/settings.js`

### 4. Verified Functionality

#### Server Startup

- ✅ All routes load properly
- ✅ WebSocket server initializes correctly
- ✅ Logger system operational

#### File Structure
- ✅ All directories present and correct
- ✅ No orphaned or unused files
- ✅ .gitignore and .dockerignore properly configured

## Files Modified

### Documentation (5 files)
1. `README.md` - Comprehensive feature and API documentation
2. `QUICKSTART.md` - Updated usage workflow
3. `ARCHITECTURE.md` - System architecture updates
4. `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - Complete feature list
5. `.env.example` - Configuration cleanup

### Source Code (6 files)
1. `routes/storage.js` - Logger integration
2. `routes/settings.js` - Logger integration, syntax fix
3. `routes/upload.js` - Logger integration
4. `routes/tts.js` - Logger integration
5. `services/ttsService.js` - Logger integration, duplicate catch block fixes
6. `server.js` - Already had logger integrated

## Current Feature Set

### Core Functionality
- ✅ OpenAI API integration
- ✅ OpenAI-compatible endpoint support
- ✅ Text splitting at sentence boundaries (4096 char limit)
- ✅ FFmpeg audio stitching
- ✅ Multiple format support (MP3, Opus, AAC, FLAC)

### UI/UX
- ✅ Collapsible sidebar
- ✅ Dark/Light theme toggle
- ✅ Responsive mobile design
- ✅ Drag-and-drop file upload
- ✅ Real-time log viewer with color coding
- ✅ Audio player with controls

### File Management
- ✅ Document upload (TXT, HTML, DOCX, PDF)
- ✅ Text extraction from documents
- ✅ File listing with play/download/rename/delete
- ✅ Optional custom filename input (max 50 chars) with automatic sanitization
- ✅ Timestamp-based filename generation (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-customname-voice.ext or YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-voice.ext)
- ✅ Extension preservation on rename

### Voice Selection
- ✅ Cascading filters (Model → Language → Gender → Voice)
- ✅ Dynamic voice list updates
- ✅ Gender filtering (Male, Female, Neutral)
- ✅ Language/locale filtering

### Monitoring
- ✅ WebSocket-based log streaming at `/logs`
- ✅ Live backend operation monitoring
- ✅ Color-coded log messages (info/success/warn/error)
- ✅ Auto-scroll log viewer
- ✅ 100-message buffer for new clients
- ✅ Auto-reconnect on disconnect

## Verification Steps Completed

1. ✅ Searched for and eliminated all `console.log` statements in backend (except logger.js fallback)
2. ✅ Searched for TODO/FIXME markers (only found in template files, not in actual code)
3. ✅ Verified all environment variables are documented in .env.example
4. ✅ Verified all dependencies in package.json are used
5. ✅ Tested server startup - successful
6. ✅ Verified no linting/compile errors
7. ✅ Confirmed Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml are current
8. ✅ Verified all API endpoints documented in README

## Dependencies Status

All dependencies in package.json are actively used:
- ✅ `axios` - TTS API calls
- ✅ `cors` - CORS middleware
- ✅ `dotenv` - Environment variables
- ✅ `express` - Web framework
- ✅ `fluent-ffmpeg` - Audio processing
- ✅ `html-to-text` - HTML text extraction
- ✅ `mammoth` - DOCX parsing
- ✅ `multer` - File upload handling
- ✅ `node-html-parser` - HTML parsing
- ✅ `pdf-parse` (v1.1.1) - PDF text extraction
- ✅ `ws` - WebSocket server

## Known Limitations

- Storage monitoring features removed (MAX_STORAGE_MB related code still exists in storage.js but unused in UI)
- Log viewer HTML already present in index.html (no changes needed)
- Public app.js uses console.error for client-side errors (intentional - browser console logging)

## Recommendations for Future

1. Consider removing storage monitoring code entirely if not needed
2. Add user authentication if multi-user deployment needed
3. Consider adding health check endpoint for monitoring
4. Add metrics/analytics for usage tracking
5. Consider implementing API rate limiting
6. Add SSML support for advanced voice control

## Conclusion

The OpenSpeech project has been comprehensively cleaned up with:
- ✅ All documentation updated to reflect current features
- ✅ Code logging standardized throughout backend
- ✅ All syntax errors fixed
- ✅ Server tested and operational
- ✅ Configuration files current and accurate

The project is production-ready with all features properly documented and functional.
