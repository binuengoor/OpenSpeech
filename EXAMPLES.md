# OpenSpeech - Usage Examples

## Example 1: Using Official OpenAI TTS

### Configuration:
- **Service Type**: Official OpenAI
- **API Key**: `sk-proj-...` (your OpenAI API key)

### Sample Text:
```
Welcome to OpenSpeech, a powerful text-to-speech application. This example demonstrates how to convert text into natural-sounding speech using OpenAI's advanced TTS technology.
```

### Settings:
- **Voice**: nova (female, en-US)
- **Speed**: 1.0x
- **Format**: MP3
- **Combine Audio**: âœ“ Enabled

---

## Example 2: Long Text with Auto-Splitting

### Sample Text (10,000+ characters):
```
In the realm of artificial intelligence, text-to-speech technology has made remarkable advances. These systems can now produce speech that is nearly indistinguishable from human voices, with natural intonation, emotion, and clarity.

The journey of TTS technology began decades ago with robotic, mechanical-sounding voices. Early systems used concatenative synthesis, piecing together pre-recorded sound fragments. While functional, these systems lacked the naturalness and expressiveness of human speech.

Modern TTS systems leverage deep learning and neural networks to generate speech that captures the nuances of human communication. These systems analyze vast amounts of speech data, learning patterns of pronunciation, rhythm, and intonation. The result is synthetic speech that sounds remarkably human-like.

The future of text-to-speech technology holds exciting possibilities. As AI continues to advance, we can expect even more natural, expressive, and personalized synthetic voices. These developments will further democratize access to information and communication, making technology more accessible to everyone.
```

### What Happens:
- âœ… Text is automatically split into ~3 chunks at sentence boundaries
- âœ… Each chunk is processed separately via TTS API
- âœ… All audio files are seamlessly stitched into one continuous track
- âœ… Final output plays as a single, uninterrupted audio stream

## Example 3: Using OpenAI-Compatible Endpoint (Azure Edge TTS)

### Configuration:
- **Service Type**: OpenAI-Compatible Endpoint
- **Custom Endpoint**: `http://localhost:8080`
- **API Key**: (any value, or leave blank if not required)

### Available Voices (auto-populated):
After saving settings, the application queries `/v1/voices` and discovers:
- en-US-JennyNeural (Female, American English)
- en-GB-SoniaNeural (Female, British English)
- fr-FR-DeniseNeural (Female, French)
- de-DE-KatjaNeural (Female, German)
- es-ES-ElviraNeural (Female, Spanish)
- And many more...

### Sample Text:
```
Bonjour! This is a multilingual example. OpenSpeech works with various TTS services, including self-hosted solutions like Azure Edge TTS. You can generate speech in multiple languages with different voices and accents.
```

### Settings:
- **Voice**: en-GB-SoniaNeural
- **Speed**: 1.2x (slightly faster)
- **Format**: Opus
- **Combine Audio**: âœ“ Enabled

---

## Example 4: Multiple Audio Formats

### MP3 (Default)
- **Best for**: General use, compatibility
- **File size**: Medium
- **Quality**: High

### Opus
- **Best for**: Low bandwidth, streaming
- **File size**: Smallest
- **Quality**: Excellent for speech

### AAC
- **Best for**: Apple devices, iTunes
- **File size**: Medium
- **Quality**: High

### FLAC
- **Best for**: Archival, maximum quality
- **File size**: Largest
- **Quality**: Lossless

---

## Example 5: Speed Variations

### 0.5x - Slow (Learning/Accessibility)
```
Perfect for language learning, elderly users, or complex technical content.
```

### 1.0x - Normal (Default)
```
Natural speaking pace, ideal for most content including articles, books, and general text.
```

### 1.5x - Fast (Efficiency)
```
Great for consuming large amounts of content quickly while maintaining clarity and comprehension.
```

### 2.0x+ - Very Fast (Advanced)
```
For experienced listeners who want to maximize content consumption speed.
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Generation failed"
- Verify API key is correct
- Check API quota/limits
- Ensure internet connectivity

### "Connection test failed"
- Double-check endpoint URL
- Verify API service is running
- Check firewall/network settings

### "Audio sounds choppy"
- Issue with stitching - check FFmpeg installation
- Try disabling combine audio to test individual chunks
- Verify sufficient disk space

### "Voice not available"
